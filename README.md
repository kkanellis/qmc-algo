#Quine–McCluskey Algorithm 

Simple implementation of [Quine–McCluskey algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm) for educational purposes in C language. It uses arrays and lists to provide a good demonstration (hopefully) of their utility in an actual algorithm.

##Input format

The input format is given in a single string, containing all the minterms of the function we want to minimize. Example:

<pre>	>> 0,2,5,8,9,13,15 </pre>

The input above is equivalent to the function below:

<pre>	F = Σm(0,2,5,8,9,13,15) </pre>

## TODO
- Show *prime implicant chart* followed by *essentials* prime implicants
- Complete *minimizing* boolean function
- Support for *don't care* conditions
- Input format as boolean function
